# Magnetic_Coupler


Project Objective :  
   
    the project objective is to design and manufacture Motor testing setup.
    
Project Duration :
    
    August 2021 ; during my internship period in MRS research Lab -Multi Robot Systems- in german university in cairo.
    
Project Description :   
    First the system is designed and modeled on Solidworks and then the designed parts is manufactured using Laser cutting machine , conventional Lathe , conventional milling machine ,and CNC bending machine. It was desired to measure the torque of a motor that wanted to be tested however applying so much force on the motor shaft may hurt the motor ,so I choosed the magnetic coupler to be added to the system to add the following :
        - Mechanical fusing.
        - No load starting.
At the end the system succeded to acheive the desired objective to measure the motor torque , no load speed electrical power ,and efficiency.
